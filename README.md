## Introduction

The QR Ticket Booking System is a web application designed to simplify and streamline the process of booking tickets for museums, monuments, and other visitor attractions. This system leverages QR code technology to generate unique tickets for each booking, making entry to these places hassle-free and secure. The application stores all data in a MongoDB database, ensuring robust data management and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Management**: Admin can manage user accounts, including creation, deletion, and updating user details.

- **Role Management**: Different roles can be assigned to users (e.g., Admin, Staff, Visitor), each with specific permissions and access levels.

- **Museum/Monument Management**: Admin can add, edit, and remove museums and monuments from the system, including details like name, location, working hours, and ticket pricing.

- **Ticket Management**: Users can book tickets for specific museums or monuments based on availability and pricing. Each booking receives a unique QR code for easy validation.

- **Unique QR on each Booking**: Every ticket generated will have a distinct QR code to prevent duplication and ensure security.

- **Visitors Management**: The system keeps track of visitors and their ticket bookings for efficient visitor management and analytics.
